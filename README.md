# Cycle Detection
A linked list is a linear collection of data elements, whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of _nodes_ which together represent a sequence. In its most basic form, each _node_ contains: data, and a reference (in other words, a _link_) to the next _node_ in the sequence.

A linked list is said to contain a cycle if any node is visited more than once while traversing the list.

## What you need to do...
1. Create a data structure that will be used for your linked list.
1. Create function that will receive one parameter: a pointer to a _node_ object named _head_ that points to the head of a linked list. Your function must return a boolean denoting whether or not there is a cycle in the list. If there is a cycle, return true; otherwise, return false.
